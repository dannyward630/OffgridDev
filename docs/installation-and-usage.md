# Installation & Usage

[← Back to README](../README.md)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (must be running)
  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### Windows
1. Download repo as ZIP
2. Extract to:
```
C:\OffgridDev
```

### macOS / Linux
```
~/offgriddev
```

## Starting OffgridDev

> Docker Desktop **must already be running**.

### Windows
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\offgriddev-start.ps1
```
(PowerShell's default execution policy blocks double-clicking `.ps1` files; the flag above runs this script
without changing your system-wide policy.)

### macOS / Linux
```
./scripts/offgriddev-start.sh
```

## Stopping

### Windows
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\offgriddev-stop.ps1
```

### macOS / Linux
```
./scripts/offgriddev-stop.sh
```

## Web Interface

Open:

http://localhost:3000

Use it to chat, test prompts, and debug models.

### Login
There isn't one. `docker/docker-compose.yml` sets `WEBUI_AUTH=False`, so Open WebUI skips its
sign-in screen and runs as a single implicit local user — matching this project's
offline, single-developer-machine design.

Note: This is only safe because port 3000 is published to `localhost` by default. If you
ever change `docker-compose.yml` to expose that port on your network (or forward it
through a tunnel), remove `WEBUI_AUTH=False` first — anyone who can reach the port would
otherwise have unauthenticated access to your chats, uploaded files, and any model the
container can pull.

### Switching models
The chat model selector (top of the page) lists whatever models are currently pulled into Ollama — by
default, that's exactly the set you enabled in `config/models.env`, since VRAM gating already kept it to
models this machine can run. Switching is instant; nothing downloads at that point.

Models pulled through the startup scripts show their friendly alias name (e.g. `deepseek-r1:medium-reasoning`
instead of `deepseek-r1:7b`) — see [Model Naming](hardware-and-model-configuration.md#model-naming). Models
pulled manually via the Admin Panel (below) still show their raw Ollama tag, since they never go through the
alias step.

### Pulling additional models from the browser
You don't need the CLI to add a model later. Go to **Settings → Admin Panel → Settings → Connections →
Ollama**, enter a model tag (e.g. `qwen2.5-coder:14b`), and pull it from there — it appears in the chat
selector once the download finishes.

**This bypasses the VRAM gate.** `models.env` and the startup scripts are the only place VRAM checking
happens; pulling a model directly through Open WebUI does not check whether it fits your GPU. Stick to sizes
your [VRAM tier](hardware-and-model-configuration.md#vram) supports, or the model will fail to load or run
painfully slowly on CPU.

For a cleaner, curated switcher (friendly names instead of raw tags, or hiding the raw model list from other
users of this instance), see Open WebUI's **Workspace → Models** feature — it builds named presets on top of
already-pulled base models but doesn't change the pull/VRAM behavior above.

### Sub-agents
Open WebUI has a "Sub-agents" feature (a chat model hands off a focused piece of a task to a second
background model call, then uses the result to keep going) — **off by default in this project**, matching
Open WebUI's own default. It stays off deliberately: turning it on globally (`ENABLE_SUBAGENTS=True`)
auto-enables the Sub-agents Builtin Tool for *every* model, and several of this project's model families —
DeepSeek Coder, Gemma 3, Phi (reasoning), and both vision models — don't support Ollama tool calling at all.
Every request to one of those models then fails outright with `does not support tools`, and there's no
compose-level way to exclude just those models from the global flag. (See
[Tools errors on DeepSeek Coder / Gemma 3](troubleshooting.md#tools-errors-on-deepseek-coder--gemma-3) for
why this same failure can happen even with Sub-agents off, and how it's handled.)

If you only ever use Qwen 2.5 Coder, Qwen 3 Coder, or Devstral (all three support Ollama's tool-calling
capability) and want sub-agents, add this to the `webui` service's `environment` in `docker-compose.yml`,
then run `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d`:
```yaml
- ENABLE_SUBAGENTS=True
- SUBAGENTS_MAX_CONCURRENT=2   # upstream default is 20 - this stack pins OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1, so
                               # Ollama only ever runs one completion at a time regardless; extra
                               # slots just queue rather than parallelize on a single local GPU.
- SUBAGENTS_MAX_ITERATIONS=10 # upstream default is 30 - bounds a model looping on tool calls instead
                               # of finishing a sub-task, each iteration being a full extra completion.
```
Then, per model, go to **Workspace → Models → (edit) → Builtin Tools → Sub-agents** and set **Function
Calling** to **Native**. DeepSeek Coder and Gemma 3 already have Function Calling forced to **Legacy** by the
startup scripts, so they're unaffected either way.

## VS Code Integration

### Requirements
- VS Code
- Continue extension
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue

### Automatic Setup

The startup script writes:
```
C:\Users\<you>\.continue\config.yaml     (Windows)
~/.continue/config.yaml                  (macOS/Linux)
```

One named entry is generated per model that pulled successfully this run — friendly name, alias tag, and a
task-appropriate role set (coding models get the full `chat`/`edit`/`apply`/`autocomplete`/`rerank` set;
reasoning models get `chat`/`edit`/`apply`; Gemma (general) gets `chat`/`edit`; vision models get `chat`
only) — plus a trailing **OffgridDev Autodetect** entry that still picks up anything pulled out-of-band
through Open WebUI's manual-pull UI (see [Pulling additional models from the
browser](#pulling-additional-models-from-the-browser)), since those never go through the alias step.

Then:
1. Restart VS Code
2. Continue → Select Model → pick the named model you want (e.g. **Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B**), or
   **OffgridDev Autodetect** to see everything currently pulled into Ollama
